Welcome to the extra challenges! Do you consider yourself the git master? Do you 
think you have what it takes? Then try these challenges! However, if you can 
help out with any of the other students around you, please help them first :) 

----- 
Challenge 1 
ssh into "bandit27@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" on port 2220. 
(the password is 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea )
create a new directory inside `/tmp` and cd into it. 
clone the following git repo: 
  ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo
  (the password is 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea )

The challenge is to find the password for bandit28. 
Once you've found this, you can logout and use this password to 
log onto bandit28@bandit[..], mkdir, cd, clone, etc. etc. etc. 

If you ever get to level 32: This is no longer a git challenge. It is an interesting 
challenge nonetheless. Have fun!
